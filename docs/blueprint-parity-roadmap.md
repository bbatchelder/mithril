# Roadmap to a hands-down recommendation

> **Audience:** the analyst-ui development team.
> **Goal:** close every gap that currently makes [`comparison-vs-blueprint.md`](./comparison-vs-blueprint.md)
> recommend Blueprint for serious apps, so that analyst-ui becomes the **unconditional** choice over
> Blueprint for greenfield work — without giving up the things it already wins on (clean API, small CSS,
> ownership, React 19).
>
> Every item below traces to an adversarially-verified finding (audit of 2026-05-29, analyst-ui
> `public-readiness` vs Blueprint v6.15). Items are tiered by how much they move the recommendation.

## The core problem to internalize

analyst-ui's distribution model is *own-the-source*. That makes two things **non-optional** rather than
nice-to-have:

1. **Accessibility must be correct in the box** — consumers inherit our behavior and rarely re-derive
   keyboard/ARIA themselves.
2. **There must be a test net** — the visual comparison harness *cannot* catch a missing keyboard
   handler or ARIA attribute, and owned source with no tests silently regresses.

These two (P0) are the credibility blockers. Completeness (P1) and polish (P2/P3) come after.

---

## P0 — Credibility blockers (do these first)

> Until these land, the honest recommendation for any accessibility-sensitive app is Blueprint. These
> are the highest-leverage items by far.

> **✅ Status (2026-05-31): P0 is fully closed.** P0.1 (test foundation) and P0.2 (keyboard/ARIA gaps)
> landed via PR #13 (handoffs 0066–0073); P0.3 (`useHotkeys` engine) landed in handoff 0074. The only
> remaining accessibility-adjacent item is a live VoiceOver/NVDA pass (jsdom + axe can't validate lived
> announcements). The next work is P1 completeness.

### P0.1 — Establish a behavioral test foundation ✅ done (PR #13)

- **Problem:** 0 tests vs Blueprint's 152. Verification is screenshot-only; keyboard/ARIA regressions
  are invisible. (CLAUDE.md currently states "No unit tests — verification is visual via the harness.")
- **Action:**
  - Add Vitest + `@testing-library/react` + `@testing-library/user-event` + `jsdom`/`happy-dom`.
  - Adopt a per-component **a11y/behavior contract test** convention (keyboard map, roving focus,
    ARIA roles/attrs, controlled/uncontrolled). Start with the P0.2 components as you fix them — write
    the test *with* the fix so it locks in.
  - Add `axe-core` (`vitest-axe`) smoke assertions per component story.
  - Update CLAUDE.md/ROADMAP "no tests" policy to "visual harness for fidelity **+** unit tests for
    behavior/a11y."
- **Done when:** `pnpm test` exists and runs in CI; every component touched in P0.2/P1 ships with a
  contract test; axe smoke passes for all components.

### P0.2 — Close the hand-rolled keyboard/ARIA gaps ✅ done (PR #13)

Fix in roughly this order (highest user impact first). SegmentedControl already proves we can hand-roll
this correctly — use it as the reference pattern.

| Component | Gap (verified) | Action | Done when |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Tabs** (`tabs.tsx`) | No `onKeyDown` at all — cannot move between tabs | Add arrow-key focus movement with wrap across **enabled** tabs (Home/End optional), honoring roving `tabIndex` already present (~`:337`) | Keyboard user can traverse tabs; matches Blueprint `tabs.tsx` `handleKeyDown`; test asserts focus moves + wraps |
| **Menu / MenuItem** (`menu.tsx`) | Hardcoded `role="menuitem"`, no roving-tabindex, no arrow nav, no `roleStructure` | Add roving tabindex + Arrow/Home/End/typeahead nav; add a `roleStructure` prop (`menuitem`/`listoption`/`none`) emitting correct role + `aria-selected` | Arrow keys move active item; listbox variant emits `option`/`aria-selected`; tests cover both |
| **Select / Suggest / MultiSelect / Omnibar** | Missing the **combobox WAI-ARIA pattern** entirely | On the input/trigger set `role=combobox`, `aria-expanded`, `aria-controls`, `aria-haspopup="listbox"`, `aria-autocomplete="list"`, `aria-activedescendant`; render the list as `role=listbox` with `role=option` items (depends on Menu `roleStructure` above) | Screen reader announces active option; matches Blueprint `select.tsx` + `queryList.tsx`; tests assert the attributes track active item |
| **ContextMenu** (`context-menu.tsx`) | Wraps Radix but feeds it analyst `<Menu>`, so no arrow-nav/typeahead/submenu | Either (a) route items through `RadixContextMenu.Item`/`.Sub` so Radix's collection drives nav, or (b) reuse the now-keyboard-capable Menu from above. Add submenu support | Arrow keys + typeahead work in context menus; submenus open; test covers nav |
| **NumericInput** (`numeric-input.tsx`) | No `role=spinbutton` / `aria-value*` on the input | Add `role="spinbutton"` (when numeric-only) + `aria-valuenow/min/max` on the input, mirroring Blueprint `numericInput.tsx:466-471` | SR announces a spinbutton with current/min/max; test asserts values update on step |
| **Alert** (`alert.tsx`) | `role="dialog"` not `alertdialog` | Override the Radix Content role to `alertdialog` (or set `aria-roledescription`) for confirmation semantics | Alert exposes `role="alertdialog"`; test asserts it |
| **Hotkeys** (`hotkeys.tsx`) | ✅ done (handoff 0074) — `useHotkeys` engine added; see **P0.3** | — | Combos fire; `?` opens the dialog; 16 behavior tests |

### P0.3 — Add a `useHotkeys` engine ✅ done (handoff 0074)

- **Problem:** `hotkeys.tsx` only renders `KeyCombo` + a dialog; there is no event binding. Blueprint's
  `useHotkeys` registers global + local `keydown`/`keyup`, parses combos (`getKeyCombo`/`comboMatches`),
  dispatches callbacks, and opens the help dialog on `?`.
- **Action:** Implement a `useHotkeys(hotkeys)` hook + provider that binds listeners, parses combos
  (with platform mod-key handling), dispatches `onKeyDown`/`onKeyUp`, respects input-target exclusion,
  and wires `?` → open the existing `HotkeysDialog`. Keep `KeyCombo`/dialog as the presentation layer.
- **Done when:** registering a hotkey actually fires; `?` opens the dialog from real bindings; tests
  cover combo matching + dispatch + the `?` shortcut.
- **✅ Resolved (handoff 0074):** `useHotkeys(keys, options)` + `HotkeysProvider`/`HotkeysContext` +
  `parseKeyCombo`/`getKeyCombo`/`comboMatches` ported into `hotkeys.tsx` (one self-contained file).
  Global + local binding, input-target exclusion (`allowInInput`), `disabled`/`preventDefault`/
  `stopPropagation`, and `?` → dialog all work. 16 behavior tests in `hotkeys.test.tsx`; dogfooded in
  the Skylark demo (`src/demos/mission/MissionControl.tsx`). No new deps.

> Listed under both P0 and P1 because it is *both* an a11y/behavior correctness item and a missing
> capability.

---

## P1 — Completeness (close the capability gaps)

> These are the components/capabilities Blueprint has and analyst lacks. Without them, Blueprint stays
> the answer for any app that needs them.

### P1.1 — Data grid (the big one)

- **Problem:** No equivalent to Blueprint's **Table2** (~13k LOC: virtualized rows/cols, selection,
  resize, reorder, editable cells, clipboard). `html-table` is CSS-only.
- **Action:** Build a `DataTable`/`Table` component. Strongly consider composing a headless engine
  (e.g. TanStack Table + TanStack Virtual) under analyst's API + tokens rather than re-deriving 13k LOC.
  Cover: column resize/reorder, row/cell/region selection, editable cells, sticky headers, virtualized
  scroll, keyboard cell navigation, clipboard copy.
- **Done when:** a virtualized, selectable, resizable grid ships with keyboard nav + tests; documented
  in the gallery and registry.
- **Note:** This is a multi-loop effort — scope it as its own phase. It is the single largest lever for
  "feature parity."

### P1.2 — Hotkey engine ✅ done (handoff 0074)

See **P0.3** (cross-listed) — resolved.

### P1.3 — Missing composite & infra components

| Missing | Action | Done when |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **MultistepDialog / DialogStep** ✅ done (handoff 0077) | Build on existing Dialog: step state, footer nav (Back/Next/Submit), per-step panels | Multi-step wizard works; registry + gallery + tests |
| **ButtonGroup** ✅ done (handoff 0075) | Layout/segmentation wrapper around Button (attached borders, vertical, fill) | Matches Blueprint visuals; registry entry |
| **AnchorButton** ✅ done (handoff 0076) | `<a>`-rendered button variant reusing Button's `buttonVariants` | Renders `<a role="button">` with button styling + disabled semantics; registry entry |
| **Standalone `ResizeSensor`, `OverflowList`, `Portal`/provider** | Promote the privately-inlined behaviors (OverflowList exists inside Breadcrumbs) to exported, reusable components/hooks | Each is independently importable + registered + tested |

---

## P2 — Distribution & DX polish (turn near-wins into clean wins)

### P2.1 — Make the shadcn install path actually work

- **Problem:** `registry.json` is generated but **never served** — only the demo gallery is deployed.
  The README's `npx shadcn add <url>/button` is aspirational; the only real path today is hand-copying.
- **Action:** Serve the registry: emit `registry.json` (and per-item JSON if needed) into the deployed
  `public/` output, wire the deploy (GitHub Pages/CI) to publish it at a stable URL, and verify
  `npx shadcn@latest add <url>/<component>` end-to-end. Add a CI check that regenerates the registry
  (`pnpm gen:registry`) and fails on drift (the manifest is only "can't drift" by discipline today).
- **Done when:** a fresh project can install any component via the documented command; CI guards
  registry freshness.

### P2.2 — Fix icon tree-shaking

- **Problem:** All 706 glyphs live in one `ICON_GLYPHS` `Record`, synchronously indexed — importing
  `Icon` drags in **~195 KB gzip** with zero tree-shaking. Blueprint ships per-icon ES modules + async
  split-by-size loading.
- **Action:** Change `tools/gen-icons.mjs` to emit **one module per glyph** (e.g.
  `icons/glyphs/<name>.ts`) plus an optional async registry/loader, so a bundler drops unused glyphs.
  Keep a convenience barrel for "I want them all," but make per-icon import the default path. Preserve
  the `IconName` union typing that avoids TS2590 (see icons memory).
- **Done when:** importing `Icon` + using 3 glyphs ships ≈ those 3, not 195 KB; measured in a sample
  bundle; documented.

### P2.3 — Unify the type vocabulary ✅ done (handoff 0079)

- **Resolved (handoff 0079):** added `src/lib/types.ts` exporting one `Intent` (registered as a `types`
  registry:lib item, pulled in transitively like `cn`). All 18 `*Intent` unions now alias it
  (`export type ButtonIntent = Intent`), keeping each component's public type name while the vocabulary
  is defined once; `SegmentedControlIntent` narrows via `Extract<Intent, "none" | "primary">`. A consumer
  can now write `(intent: Intent) => …` generically.
- **Problem:** No shared `Intent` type — ~19 duplicated `*Intent` string unions
  (`ButtonIntent`, `MenuIntent`, `TagIntent`, `InputGroupIntent`, …). Consumers can't write generic
  intent-typed helpers. Blueprint has shared `IntentProps`/`ActionProps`/`ControlledValueProps`/
  `OptionProps`.
- **Action:** Introduce a shared `types.ts` (or `lib/`) exporting one `Intent`, plus small shared prop
  mixins, and have components reference them. Keep the shadcn "self-contained file" ergonomics in mind —
  a single tiny shared types module is an acceptable shared dep (like `cn`).
- **Done when:** one `Intent` type is the single source; components import it; a consumer can type
  `(intent: Intent) => …` generically.

### P2.4 — Normalize the icon prop convention ✅ done (handoff 0079)

- **Resolved (handoff 0079):** added `resolveIcon()` + the `IconProp` type to `icon.tsx`. Every icon slot
  now accepts `IconProp` (`IconName | React.ReactElement | false | null` — NOT `… | ReactNode`, which
  would collapse to `ReactNode` and kill `IconName` autocomplete; mirrors Blueprint's `IconName |
  MaybeElement`). Wired into button, anchor-button, callout, dialog, drawer, tag, segmented-control, and
  alert (upgraded). A string renders as `<Icon>` with host-appropriate size/color; custom elements pass
  through. `<Button icon="add" />` / `<Callout icon="info-sign" />` now work with no `<Icon>` import.
- **Problem:** Inconsistent: `MenuItem.icon` is `IconName` (string) but `Button.icon`/`endIcon` are
  `React.ReactNode`, forcing `icon={<Icon icon="add" />}` + an import for every button.
- **Action:** Accept `IconName | React.ReactNode` everywhere (string → render `<Icon>` internally).
  Apply library-wide so the low-boilerplate `icon="floppy-disk"` form works consistently.
- **Done when:** `<Button icon="add" />` works; all icon-accepting components share the convention.

### P2.5 — Restore a derivable token pipeline (or document the freeze)

- **Problem:** analyst bakes resolved sRGB literals (incl. one-off hex like `#303740`) and hand-patches
  dark intent/tag shades; Blueprint derives them via `oklch(from <intent> …)` so the whole theme
  re-derives from one variable.
- **Action (choose one):**
  - **(a) Derive at runtime:** express dark surfaces/intent-text as `oklch(from var(--intent) …)` /
    `color-mix()` in `tokens.css`, so re-theming from one intent var works — *and* add the `@supports`
    fallback (see P2.6).
  - **(b) Derive at build:** add a small token-build step (Style-Dictionary-style) that *computes* the
    literals from a single source so they can't drift and can re-target a new spec version.
  - If neither is pursued, explicitly document "frozen to Blueprint v6.15" as an intentional limitation.
- **Done when:** changing the primary intent var re-tints the theme (option a), or a documented build
  regenerates all derived values (option b).

### P2.6 — Add progressive-enhancement fallbacks

- **Problem:** ~15 raw `oklch()`/`color-mix()` usages with **no `@supports` fallback**; Blueprint
  degrades gracefully on engines lacking relative-color/oklch.
- **Action:** Wrap modern-color usages with `@supports` static-hex fallbacks (the hex values already
  exist as the resolved literals).
- **Done when:** the theme renders correctly on an engine without `oklch(from …)` support.

### P2.7 — Dark-mode selector & native-control parity

- **Problem:** analyst wires only `.dark`; Blueprint supports class **and** `[data-*]` selectors and
  sets `color-scheme: dark` so native scrollbars/controls theme.
- **Action:** Add `color-scheme` to the dark scope; optionally support a data-attribute selector
  alongside `.dark`.
- **Done when:** native form controls/scrollbars follow dark mode; both selector styles work.

### P2.8 — MenuItem submenus + Popover hover; controlled-input safety

- **MenuItem submenus:** the no-op `hasSubmenu` caret was **removed** (it was a misleading affordance —
  see handoff 0071). Submenus remain unbuilt: add declarative children-driven submenus (like Blueprint's
  auto hover-Popover) — for the ContextMenu case via Radix `*.Sub` through `MenuItemSlotContext`, and a
  hosted model (likely Radix `DropdownMenu`) for standalone menus.
- **Popover `interactionKind`:** add `hover`/`hover-target-only` modes (+ open/close delays) so
  hovercards can be Popovers. analyst already has `matchTargetWidth`; this fills the remaining behavioral
  gap. (Radix Popover is click/focus-only — may need a small hover wrapper or Floating UI for hover.)
- **Controlled inputs:** consider an `AsyncControllableInput`-equivalent / shared controlled-state
  helper instead of per-component `internalChecked` + `useEffect` mirroring, to dodge the known React
  controlled-input pitfall once and consistently.
- **Done when:** nested `<MenuItem>` renders a submenu; Popover supports hover; controlled inputs share
  one safe pattern with tests.

---

## P3 — Hardening & longevity

- **P3.1 — CI for the comparison harness.** Run `tools/compare.sh` in CI (or a CI-friendly variant) so
  fidelity regressions are caught automatically, not point-in-time by hand.
- **P3.2 — Widen the computed-style gate.** The gate omits `fontFamily`, `lineHeight`, vertical padding,
  and `borderStyle` — add them (or add explicit visual-regression image diffs) to close the documented
  blind spots that hid Button width / Checkbox-Radio row-height drift.
- **P3.3 — Broaden React peer range** if you want to court Blueprint's installed base (currently React
  19-only); at minimum document the React 19 requirement prominently.
- **P3.4 — Per-component a11y status badges** in the gallery/registry so consumers can see what's been
  behavior-tested vs visual-only (interim honesty while P0.2 rolls out).
- **P3.5 — Migration note from Blueprint** (prop-name mapping table) to lower switching cost for
  existing Blueprint users.

---

## What "hands-down" looks like (acceptance)

analyst-ui becomes the unconditional recommendation over Blueprint when **all** of the following are
true:

1. **A11y parity:** Tabs/Menu/Select-family/ContextMenu/NumericInput/Alert/Hotkeys all pass keyboard +
   ARIA contract tests and `axe` smoke (P0.2, P0.3).
2. **Test net:** every component has behavior/a11y unit tests running in CI (P0.1); fidelity harness runs
   in CI (P3.1).
3. **Completeness:** a real data grid, hotkey engine, and MultistepDialog/ButtonGroup/AnchorButton ship
   (P1).
4. **Install path works:** `npx shadcn add` installs from a served registry, guarded against drift (P2.1).
5. **Icons tree-shake** (P2.2) and the **type vocabulary is unified** (P2.3); icon prop convention is
   consistent (P2.4).
6. **Theme is derivable** (or the freeze is a documented, fallback-backed intentional choice) with
   `@supports` graceful degradation (P2.5, P2.6).

At that point analyst-ui keeps everything it already wins — cleaner API, ~16.6 KB CSS, lean deps,
React 19, owned source, verified fidelity — **and** matches Blueprint on the axes where Blueprint
currently wins. That is the hands-down state.

## Suggested sequencing

1. **Phase A (P0): ✅ complete.** test foundation → Tabs → Menu/MenuItem roleStructure → Select-family
   combobox ARIA → ContextMenu → NumericInput/Alert → `useHotkeys`. *(Accessibility recommendation gap
   closed; only a live VoiceOver/NVDA pass remains.)*
2. **Phase B (P1):** MultistepDialog/ButtonGroup/AnchorButton + promoted infra → **then** the data grid
   as its own multi-loop phase. *(Closes the completeness gap.)*
3. **Phase C (P2):** serve the registry + CI drift guard → icon tree-shaking → shared `Intent` + icon
   prop convention → token derivation + `@supports` + `color-scheme`.
4. **Phase D (P3):** harness in CI, widen the style gate, badges, migration guide.
